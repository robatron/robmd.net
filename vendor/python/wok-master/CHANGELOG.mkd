----------------------------
In which contributors rock.

    [robatron].
-   A new contributed hook, `wok.contrib.hooks.compile_sass`, that does exactly
    what it says on the tin [robatron].

### Fixes
-   The hook `site.output.post` is now only run once, not once per file.

Version 0.9
-----------
In which things get interesting.

### Features
-   Site hooks, for arbitrary inserting python code into the rendering process.
-   Add a documentation wok site.
-   New template variable, `site.slugs`, to access pages in a url-agnostic way.
-   Date, datetime, and time url variables.

Version 0.8.2
-------------
In which we leave 1970.

### Fixes
-   Fix Github issue 62, in which the next page object was not set on the first
    page of a two page group.
-   Dates, datetimes, and times now have a default value of `None` instead of
    the epoch time.

Version 0.8.1
-------------
In which I document things.

### Features
-   New template variable, `site.slugs`, which is a dictionary from slugs to
    pages.
-   New variables for url generation: date, time, and datetime, which can be
    used to make urls like "/blog/2012/01/26/new-wok-version"
-   There is now a doc site, which is a simple wok site that explains how to
    use wok, and serves as a simple example.

Version 0.8
-----------
In which URLs get cleaner.

### Features

-   Added `make_file` metadata option.
-   Previews can be specified, both as part of content, or metadata headers.
-   Add option to not put "index.html" on the end of URLs, for prettification.

### Fixes
-   The `published` metadata option will now prevent pages from showing up in
    any page's metadata, as intended.

### Deprecated
-   URL patterns should use {ext} instead of {type} to specify the extension
    that was used on the template, because type is confusing, being the same
    name as the metadata option that specifies the template to choose.

In which I deprecate my first featured.
