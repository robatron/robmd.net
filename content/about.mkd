My name is Rob McGuire-Dale, and I recently graduated from [Oregon State University][osu] with a [B.S.][bs] in [computer science][compsci]. I currently work for [The Boeing Company] as a software functional analyst. In the past, I have worked as a software developer for [The Open Source Lab][osuosl], and a film editor/animation instructor at [The NW Film Center][nwfc] of [the Portland Art Museum][artmuseum].

I am interested in the **more-social aspects of computer science**, e.g., [Open source software and community][opensource] development, **the web** as a computing platform, [human-computer interaction][hci], and **project management**. I prefer working with **Linux**, and favorite languages are **Python** and **JavaScript**. I am also familiar with many other languages, frameworks, tools and technologies such as [Django][django], [jQuery][jquery], [Git][git], [AJAX][ajax], HTML, CSS, [Drupal][drupal], Java, C/C++, PHP, and [Subversion (SVN)][svn], among others.
    
Last summer, I gave a [talk][osbridge_talk] at [Open Source Bridge][osbridge] about a project I was heavily involved with called 'TouchScreen', an open source interactive kiosk framework.

For more details, please see my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;][resume]. Please feel free to [contact me][contact] if you have any questions or comments.
