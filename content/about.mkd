My name is Rob McGuire-Dale, and I recently graduated from 
[Oregon State University][osu] with a [B.S.][bs] in 
[computer science][compsci]. I am currently working as an Cyber Security
Assessor (A.K.A. [penetration tester][pentest], or 
[white hat hacker][whitehat]) for [Boeing Information Security][boeing].

In the past, I have worked as a software developer for 
[The Open Source Lab][osl], and a film editor/animation instructor at 
[The NW Film Center][nwfc] of [the Portland Art Museum][artmuseum].

I am interested in **the more-social aspects of computer science**, 
e.g., [open source][opensource] software and community development, the 
[web][internet] as a computing platform, [human-computer interaction][hci] and 
[cyber security][cybsec].

I prefer working with **Linux**, and favorite languages are **Python** and
**JavaScript**. I am also familiar with many other languages, frameworks, 
tools, and technologies such as [Django][], [jQuery][], [Git][], [AJAX][], 
HTML, CSS, [Drupal][], Java, C/C++, PHP, and [Subversion (SVN)][svn].

Summer of 2010, I gave a [talk][talk] at [Open Source Bridge][osbridge]
about a project I was heavily involved with called '[TouchScreen][]', an open-
source interactive kiosk framework.
