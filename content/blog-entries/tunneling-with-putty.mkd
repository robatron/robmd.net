[Tunneling][wp-tunneling] is the process of encapsulating one kind of network 
traffic (the [payload][]) inside of another kind of network traffic (the 
container). The resulting traffic would look just like the container traffic to
an outside observer.

A common type of network tunnel is the *[SSH][] tunnel*, which can be used to 
transfer network traffic through untrusted zones in a secure way. With an SSH
tunnel, each [packet][] of the payload traffic is wrapped inside an 
[encrypted][encrypt] SSH packet.

# SSH tunnel usage examples

## Secure your Internet traffic at the coffee shop

Let's say you would like to transfer your personal email or Internet browsing 
traffic through an untrusted zone like a public WiFi network. You could 
create an encrypted SSH tunnel from your computer to a trusted network to 
ensure your traffic stays secure.

## Circumvent firewalls and web filters

Firewalls and web filters block access to websites and other Internet services,
usually for the purpose of squelching content and services deemed inappropriate
by the individuals, organizations, or governments controlling them. The problem
is, these systems also prevent access to useful and important content and 
services. This can result in anything from minor annoyances like being
blocked from [Wikipedia][wp] at school or work, to a government or organization
censoring political events.

# Creating an SSH tunnel with PuTTY

Here's a guide on how to create an SSH tunnel with PuTTY. This
guide makes the following assumptions:

- You have a Windows machine and administrative access
- You have SSH access to a trusted server
- The network you are tunnelling through allows SSH traffic


## Install PuTTY on your computer

Download and install PuTTY from its [download page][putty-download].

[putty-download]: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

## Test the connection to your SSH server

Run PuTTY and make sure you can connect to your SSH server from the network
you're trying to tunnel through.

## Set up PuTTY as a local proxy

Once you're sure you can connect to your SSH server normally, you can set PuTTY
to act like a local [SOCKS proxy][socks], and tunnel all of your system's 
traffic to your SSH server.

[socks]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS

1. Under *connection*, expand *SSH*, and click on *Tunnels*
1. Enter a local *source port* to run the proxy on, e.g., `8888`, and
choose *Dynamic* for the *Destination*
1. Click *add*

**Note:** It's probably a good idea to save this configuration as a session
so you don't have to configure it each time.

## Configure Windows to connect through the proxy

Next, we'll need to configure Windows to connect through the local proxy you 
just created.

1. Open *Internet Options* from the *Control Panel*
1. Click on the *Connections* tab, and then the *LAN settings* button
1. Check the box *Use a proxy server for your LAN* and enter `localhost` for 
the *Address* and the port number you chose in the last step, e.g., `8888` in
the *Port* field
1. Click *OK* and *OK* again

**Note:** Alternatively, you could set up individual programs to use the proxy
instead of your whole system.

## Log in and connect

That's it! Just log into your SSH server like normal, and the tunnel should 
open up. Now you're browsing with <del>portals</del> tunnels.
