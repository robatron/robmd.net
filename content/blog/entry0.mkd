Finally, I finally have a forward-facing web site for myself. Here's how it happened:

Recently, my friend Adam DiCarlo switched VPS hosting services. I just happened to ask at the right time, and we decided to go halfsies on the monthly bill if he'd let me use it. Also, he's a bit of a Drupal guru, and he set up the new VPS to make Drupal scream.

Fast forward to tonight, add in a few hours of work, and I finally have a somewhat-functioning personal web site. I don't think I've had one of these since I was in middle or high school!

Anyway, Drupal is amazing, and Adam's awesome.
