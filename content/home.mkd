My name is Rob McGuire-Dale, and I recently graduated from [Oregon State University][osu] with a [B.S.][bs] in [computer science][compsci]. I am currently participating in the [Information Systems Career Foundation Program (ISCFP)][iscfp] at [The Boeing Company][boeing]. The ISCFP is a leadership roation program that will allow me to rotate through different roles within Boeing Information Systems. I am currently serving my first rotation as a software functional analyst.

I have strong passion for **the more-social aspects of computer science**, e.g., [open source software and community][opensource] development, the [web][internet], [human-computer interaction][hci], and project management. I also love [old motorcycles][motoblog], tinkering with vehicles, and commuting on my bicycle. Most importantly, I have an immense interest and curiosity about the world, which drives me to learn.
