My name is Rob McGuire-Dale, and I am a senior at [Oregon State University][osu] studying [computer science][compsci]. I work as a software developer for the [Open Source Lab][osuosl]. 

I have strong passion for **the more-social aspects of computer science**, e.g., [open source software and community][opensource] development, the [web][internet], [human-computer interaction][hci], and project management. I also love [old motorcycles][motoblog], tinkering with vehicles, and commuting on my bicycle. 

Most importantly, I have an immense interest and curiosity about the world, which drives me to learn.
