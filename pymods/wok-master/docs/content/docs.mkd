Install
-------
If you just want to use wok, then you should install it from the 
[Python Package Index][pypi]. A good way to do that is with `pip`:

    ::console
    $ sudo pip install wok

This will install wok and the required dependencies. It will also install some optional dependencies: the two rendering libraries, [Markdown][mkd], and [reStructuredTest][rst]. It will also install a syntax highlighting library, [Pygments][pymnts].

[pypi]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
[mkd]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
[rst]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
[pgmnts]: http://pygments.org/

Tutorial
--------
For a quick start guide to wok, check out [the tutorial](/tutorial/), which
goes over some basics about content and templates. Nothing too fancy, but it
should get you started.

Contribute
----------
You can find wok's source code on [Github][gh]. If you find any issues,
please post them to [the issue tracker][gh-issues]. If you want to help
code, feel free. Patches and pull requests are welcome.
